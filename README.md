A random location generator built with basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

It's currently being used to provide random walking trails throughout the Niagara Region. Each click gives a location, image and description. 

The ability to see the location on Google maps was recently added. 

In the future I would like to add more functionality such as the ability to view more photos of each location, a filter system (ie. by distance from current location), parking info, and a light/dark mode.

Current issue:
    -the web app has to be viewed in full-window mode and is not responsive
